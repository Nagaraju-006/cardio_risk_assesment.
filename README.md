## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 ML-Powered Risk Prediction
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA with visualizations
- Feature engineering (e.g., BMI, pulse pressure)
- Model training with cross-validation (KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Best model saved via `joblib`

### 🌐 Web Interface (Flask)
- Intuitive input form for key health parameters
- Loads pre-trained ML model for risk scoring
- Uses **Google Gemini API** to:
  - Identify likely contributing factors
  - Suggest lifestyle improvements (with a typing effect)
- Responsive layout with a compact two-column design

### ⚠️ Educational Use Only
- Includes a built-in disclaimer: not a substitute for medical advice

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate:
   # Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Train or load the ML model:**
   - Run `Cardio_Analysis.ipynb` to generate `cardiovascular_risk_*.joblib`, or
   - Use the pre-trained model if already provided

5. **Set the Gemini API key (do not hardcode it):**
   ```bash
   # Windows (cmd)
   set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

   # PowerShell
   $env:GEMINI_API_KEY='your_key_here'

   # macOS/Linux
   export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_key_here'
   ```
